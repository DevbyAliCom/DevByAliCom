## 👋 About Me

I'm Ali — a seasoned .NET developer and cloud architect with nearly two decades of experience building real-world systems. From desktop software in the early 2000s to modern cloud-native, event-driven platforms.

After relocating to Vancouver in 2025, I doubled down on two core goals:
- Build **real, intelligent systems** with .NET + AI
- Teach and share **clean, practical architecture** with the dev community

I don’t do fluff. I build. I document. I ship.
